Boolean Logic Quiz Program

Run this script with: $ python3 BooleanQuiz.py WelcomePrompt.txt AnswerSheet.txt

Program idea came from Zed at LearnCodeTheHardWay.

I was working through his Python tutorial and at Exercise 27 he asked
the students to write out flash cards of boolean expressions and to
memorize the chart.

I thought it'd be fun to write a program that would do the same thing as
writing out index cards.

Thanks Zed for the tutorial exercises and inspiration!

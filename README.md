# Boolean Logic Quiz for Python

Run this script with: $ python3 BooleanQuiz.py WelcomePrompt.txt AnswerSheet.txt

### Program idea came from Zed at [Learn Code The HardWay](https://learncodethehardway.org/)

After working through Zed's Python tutorial at Exercise 27, he asked
us to write out flash cards of boolean expressions and to
memorize the chart.

I thought it'd be fun to write a command line program that would do the same 
thing as writing out index cards.

Thanks to Zed for the tutorial exercises and inspiration!
